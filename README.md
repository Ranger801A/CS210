The project was to provide the client/user a summary of the produce purchased at the Corner Grocer by inputting data from an external file.  The program uses both C++ and Python while outputting the information in three different methods.  The program must display the purchased items and the number purchased; the user specific requested purchase item and the number of purchases; and a histogram display of all the purchased items.  

One aspect that was done well on this project was the design towards the user.  I continued to look at the display and continued to tweak the code to allow a more visually appealing output.  This was helped largely using Pythonâ€™s print functions.  With that, there are parts that could have been improved on for the next time.  The MAIN code is a bit busy.  As an afterthought, I could have cleaned up the code by placing some of the C++ code into other modules.  The breaking up of MAIN could allow troubleshooting to work better for the future.  Additionally, all the variables were public in the C++ code.  The breaking into modules would have allowed for private variables to be created too.  

Overall this project was challenging.  However, something that really gave me a problem was the menu which I set up as a switch statement.  I do not know why, but I always seem to be missing something and the switch statement will not work for me on the first pass.  Then when I am done, I think of how simple it is.  It really goes back to the devil is in the details.  The problem is that I always miss something small when I first write the switch statement.  

The exciting part of writing the code for this project was it help pull all that I have learned this term together.  Therefore, I strongly believe all the skills I used on this project will be transferable to any future projects.  And I hope that when I look back at this project that I would be able to pick it up and make it better.  This is because I tried to leave detailed comments throughout the code.  In addition, I also used variable naming conventions that reflected what and where they went.  Hence, the code should be easy to follow for myself or others.
